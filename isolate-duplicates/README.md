# Isolate Duplicates

Create a program that will take in a string as input and, if there are duplicates of more than two alphabetical characters in the string, returns the array with the first index being a string with all the extra characters in a bracket and the second index being the total number of duplicates found.

For example, the input `"aaaabbcdefffffffg"` should return `["aa[aa]bbcdeff[fffff]g", 2]`

Please also ensure that the input is a string, and return "Please enter a valid string" if it is not.
