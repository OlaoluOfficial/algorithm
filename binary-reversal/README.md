## Binary Reversal

Write a function `BinaryReversal` that takes a string parameter, which will be a positive integer.

Take its binary representation (padded to the nearest N \* 8 bits), reverse that string of bits, and then finally return the new reversed string in decimal form.

For example: if the parameter is `"47"` then the binary version of this integer is `101111` but we pad it to be `00101111`.

Your program should reverse this binary string which then becomes: `11110100` and then finally return the decimal version of this string, which is `244`.

### Examples

```
Input: "213"
Output: 171
```

```
Input: "4567"
Output: 60296
```
